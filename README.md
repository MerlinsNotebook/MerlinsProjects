- WELCOME TO MY PAGE!
- 👋 Hello, welcome to my projects page. This is @MerlinsNotebook but you can call me Merlin or simply "fancy data analyst"
- 👀 I’m focused on using programs such as python and r. These programs allow me analyze data, visualize, machine learn and deal with AI programming. 
- 🌱 I’m currently furthering my knowledge in machine learning and AI. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects! So, if you have a large file of data waiting to be cleaned then send it my way!
